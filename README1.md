## Notes

The challenges which i encountered while doing this project is Managing the state of multiple components and ensuring the data flow between the pages and  Utilized React’s useState hook to manage state locally and passed state-changing functions as props to child components
Designing a visually appealing and responsive UI that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
Creating and managing forms for adding and editing content creators, including handling file uploads for images.Used controlled components for form inputs and managed their state using React’s useState hook. Implemented file input handling to allow users to upload images.
